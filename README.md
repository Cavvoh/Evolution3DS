## Installation and upgrade

**Evolution3DS** requires [boot9strap](https://github.com/SciresM/boot9strap) to run.

Once boot9strap has been installed, simply download the [latest release archive](https://github.com/Cavvoh/Evolution3DS/releases/latest) and extract the archive onto the root of your SD card to "install" or to upgrade Evolution3DS alongside the [homebrew menu and certs bundle](https://github.com/devkitPro/3ds-hbmenu) shipped with it. Replace existing files and merge existing folders if necessary.

## Basic usage
**The Configuration menu** can be accessed by pressing <kbd>Select</kbd> at boot. The configuration file is stored in `/luma/evoconfig.ini` on the SD card (or `/rw/luma/evoconfig.ini` on the CTRNAND partition if Evolution3DS has been launched from the CTRNAND partition, which happens when SD card is missing).

**The chainloader menu** is accessed by pressing <kbd>Start</kbd> at boot, or from the configuration menu. Payloads are expected to be located in `/luma/payloads` with the `.firm` extension; if there is only one such payload, the aforementionned selection menu will be skipped. Hotkeys can be assigned to payload, for example `x_test.firm` will be chainloaded when <kbd>X</kbd> is pressed at boot.

**The overlay menu, Rosalina**, has a default button combination: <kbd>L+Down+Select</kbd>. For greater flexbility, most Rosalina menu settings aren't saved automatically, hence the "Save settings" option.

## Compiling

To build Evolution3DS:
1. Get the prerequites:
* git
* up-to-date devkitARM and libctru:
  * Install `dkp-pacman`: https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman
  * Install 3DS dev tools: `sudo dkp-pacman -S 3ds-dev --needed`
* [makerom](https://github.com/jakcron/Project_CTR) in PATH
* [firmtool](https://github.com/TuxSH/firmtool) installed
2. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Cavvoh/Evolution3DS.git`
3. Run `make`.

The produced `boot.firm` is meant to be copied to the root of your SD card for usage with Boot9Strap.

**Note:** For easy SD card file transfer, consider using [ftpd](https://github.com/mtheall/ftpd).
